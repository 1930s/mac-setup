# Bash Completion

## Installation

    $ brew install bash-completion

Bash completion will be installed in `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d`

For it to work, add this to your `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
[ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion
```

Or simply type:

    $ echo "[ -f /usr/local/etc/bash_completion ] && . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion" >> ~/.bash_profile

Restart your bash session:

    $ source ~/.bash_profile

## Usage

Once you've done this, you can use bash completion by pressing the tab key twice after a command. For example:

```bash
$ git [tab] [tab]
add            blame          cherry-pick    config         format-patch   gui            merge          push           repack         rm             stage          whatchanged
am             branch         citool         describe       fsck           help           mergetool      range-diff     replace        send-email     stash          worktree
apply          bundle         clean          diff           gc             init           mv             rebase         request-pull   shortlog       status

```
